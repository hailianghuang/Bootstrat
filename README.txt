Synopsis
----------------------
A method to correct for population stratification in testing rare variants associated with complex disorders. More details at http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/11/068999

----------------------
Prerequisites
----------------------
PLINK (version 1.9 or higher) is required for this tutorial. It can be downloaded from https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/

In addition, check whether the compiled binary, 'plink-bootstrat', can be executed in your LINUX system (it was statically compiled and linked on the SURFsara with GCC version 4.7.2). 

If the binary canâ€™t be executed in your system, make appropriate changes to the Makefile and compile the PLINK program with the Bootstrat feature in the ./plink-src/ directory. Please consult the PLINK manual (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/download.shtml#compilation) if you need help in compiling the code. 

If the system and the Makefile are properly configured, the source code can be compiled by simply typing 'make' in the ./plink-src/ directory. After a successful compilation, copy the combined binary to the tutorial directory: 

cp ./plink-src/plink ./plink-bootstrat

Now you are ready to move on with the tutorial.

----------------------
Usage
----------------------
An example dataset has been provided in './dat/' (taken from the PLINK tutorial). 

1. Generate the principal components
plink2 --bfile ./dat/wgas1 --pca --out wgas1

2. Calculate the distance matrix. The example uses principal components 1 and 2, and lambda of 3. 
./generateMatrix.r wgas1.eigenval wgas1.eigenvec 1,2 3

3. Use the distance matrix to conduct association tests 
./plink-bootstrat --bfile dat/wgas1 --Pperm prob_3.txt --assoc --perm --out bootstrat

4. Inspect the result
sort -k3g bootstrat.assoc.perm |head
